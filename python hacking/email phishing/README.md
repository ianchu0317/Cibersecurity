Notes: The program it sent the mail succefully.
The only problem was that it cannot sppoof the mail address with the google service
Most known servers today do not allow e-mail spoofing.
To do some real phishing, try to use gophish instead of python.
PHP, and SMTP they're also good to spoof the email
